##Overview

SassyCV aims to take boring resumes and make them interesting. It takes advantage of Angular's two-way data-binding. There is a form for users to enter their information and this information appears on the page as the user types. There are other fields, such as strengths, where the user can enter in a strength and enter a percentage on how adept they are at that skill. There are pre-designated sections and empty sections so the user can add any other fields that they wish. 

I have written three templates for users to choose from, drawing inspiration from graphic designer resumes. There is also an empty template with drag and drop functionality for users to design their own. There are several color themes that users can choose from if they want something more than greyscale.

I took advantage of the browser's print functionality (and save as a pdf) for users to save their resume.

##Why
I'm passionate about taking things and making them more visually compelling, especially everyday ordinary things.

As a front-end developer, I felt it was important that I have an interactive resume ([jorieclark.com/resume](jorieclark.com/resume), [hard copy/pdf](http://jorieclark.com/JorieClark_CV.pdf)). I've had an attractive resume for a couple years now and it has caught the eye of employers in the past. People have also asked me for help to make their resume visually appealing and help them stand out. I made this tool for people who don't feel confident in their design abilities or don't know how to use other tools that may be more advanced.

##Future additions:
There is a lot that can be added to this app. My current list of add-ons include:

* drag and drop for all templates
* form data available to custom template
* persistence for returning users
* more templates and themes
* toggle between letter size paper and A4

##Technologies
* Angular.js for functionality
* Skeleton as a boilerplate
* custom Sass
